# JavaScript/Node.js Standards

## Code Style

- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Handle errors appropriately

## Dependencies

Managed in [package.json](mdc:package.json):
- Keep dependencies minimal and necessary
- Update regularly for security
- Document purpose of new dependencies
- Run `npm install` after changes

## Project-Specific

- Generation scripts use Node.js
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Currently using Kendall theme from node_modules (not custom theme)
