# Development Workflow

## Testing Changes

**Do NOT automatically run serve or watch commands after making changes.**

After completing changes, **ask the user** if they want to test by running:

```bash
npm run serve:eng:watch  # For English version
npm run serve:rus:watch  # For Russian version
```

Let the user decide when and how to preview their changes.

## Build Commands

The following commands are available but should only be run when the user requests:

- `npm run build:all` - Build both language versions
- `npm run build:pdf` - Build PDF files
- `npm run serve:eng:watch` - Live preview English
- `npm run serve:rus:watch` - Live preview Russian
