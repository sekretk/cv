# Theme Guidelines

## Current State

The project currently uses the **Kendall theme** from `node_modules`:
- Package: `jsonresume-theme-kendall`
- Installed via npm and referenced in [package.json](mdc:package.json)
- Provides the styling and layout for generated HTML resumes

## Theme Directory Status

The `theme/` directory in the project root:
- **Currently NOT in use**
- Reserved for future custom theme development
- Do not modify files here expecting them to affect output

## Future Plans

There are plans to develop a custom theme:
- Custom theme will be placed in the `theme/` directory
- Will replace or extend the Kendall theme from node_modules
- Custom styling and layout specific to project needs

## Making Theme Changes (Current)

Since we're using the Kendall theme from node_modules:
1. Theme changes require modifying or overriding the npm package
2. For major customization, consider starting custom theme development
3. Document any workarounds or overrides clearly

## When Custom Theme is Ready

Once custom theme is developed:
1. Update build process to use `theme/` directory
2. Update dependencies to remove or keep Kendall as reference
3. Test thoroughly with both language versions
4. Document theme structure and customization options
