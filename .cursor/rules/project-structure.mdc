# CV Project Structure

This is a CV/resume project that generates and serves professional resumes in multiple languages.

## Resume Data Files

Resume content is stored as JSON files in the `resume` directory. Each file is named after its language:

- [resume/eng.json](mdc:resume/eng.json) - English version of the resume
- [resume/rus.json](mdc:resume/rus.json) - Russian version of the resume

**Important**: All resume content changes must be made in these JSON files first. The structure should remain consistent between language versions.

## Generated Files

- `public-eng/` and `public-rus/` - Generated HTML files (do not edit manually)
- `pdf/` - Generated PDF files (do not edit manually)
- Always regenerate HTML/PDF from the JSON source files

## Theme

- Currently using **Kendall theme** from `node_modules` (jsonresume-theme-kendall)
- `theme/` directory exists but is **not currently in use**
- **Future plans**: Create custom theme in the `theme/` directory

## Deployment

- [Dockerfile](mdc:Dockerfile) - Container configuration
- `helm/cv/` - Kubernetes Helm charts for deployment
- [package.json](mdc:package.json) - Node.js dependencies and scripts

## Development Workflow

1. Edit JSON files in `resume/` directory for content changes
2. Test locally with `npm run serve:eng:watch` or `npm run serve:rus:watch`
3. Update version in [package.json](mdc:package.json) when ready for release
4. Commit and push changes
5. Create and push a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
6. GitHub Actions automatically handles the release

## Build & Release

**Releases are automated via GitHub Actions** - see [.github/workflows/release.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/release.yml)

To create a release:
```bash
# Update version in package.json, then:
git tag 1.0.0
git push origin 1.0.0
```

GitHub Actions will:
1. Update all resume JSON files with version/date
2. Build PDF files for all languages
3. Create GitHub Release with all artifacts
4. Deploy to Kubernetes (if KUBE_CONFIG secret is set)

Development scripts:
- `npm run serve:eng:watch` - Live English preview
- `npm run serve:rus:watch` - Live Russian preview
- `npm run build:pdf` - Build PDFs locally (optional)

See [.github/workflows/release.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/release.yml) for release pipeline details
